Write Code
----------

In the following exercises you will be asked to write actual programs that
execute some work over given inputs and produce outputs.
Use the first_program.asm template to be able to receive numeric input and
produce numeric output. 

You can just copy the first_program.asm file and use it as a starting point for
any of your solutions to the following exercises.

For every program that you write, make sure that it passes the assembly
process successfully, and then try to run it to make sure that it behaves as
expected.



0.  Write a program the receives three numbers and sums those three numbers.
    Then output the result.


1.  Write a program that receives two numbers a,b and calculates their integral
    average.


2.  Write a program that receives two numbers a,b as input, and outputs the
    remainder of dividing a by b.
