Basic fasm
==========

Hello and welcome to the basic fasm exercises section. We are finally going to
write some real code and run it.

You are going to encounter three parts for this exercise. The first one will be
about reading code. The next one is about writing some code. The third part is
about fixing assembly time problems of some already written programs.

The exercises are very basic this time, as we still know pretty little about x86
assembly at this point, however they should give you the feeling of writing very
basic programs and assembling them. It will also give you the confidence to deal
with some other assembly time problems that you might see in the future.

Happy coding :)
