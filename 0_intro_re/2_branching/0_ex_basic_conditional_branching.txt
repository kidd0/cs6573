Basic Conditional Branching
---------------------------

Welcome to the Basic Conditional Branching exercises section.
This exercise has two parts: Code reading and Code writing.

Do the Code reading first. It will show you how code that branches looks like.
Then move on to the Code Writing section, where you are going to write some code
yourself.

Pay attention to the flags register and the way it is effected by different
instructions. I remind you that data transfer instructions, like MOV, do not
change the flags register.

As a hint, In this exercises section sometimes you might want to use a dummy
instruction like ADD eax,0 or SUB eax,0 for example, in order to intentionally
change the contents of the flags register.

Have fun :)
