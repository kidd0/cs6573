Control Flow
------------
g   -   go (Resume execution)
p   -   Step Over
t   -   Step Into

State
-----
r                   -   Show registers.
d[d|w|b|a] address  -   Dump [dword|word|byte|ascii] at location address
e[d,w,b] address    -   edit memory
u address           -   Unassemble at location address, and print the code
lm                  -   Show list of loaded modules
k                   -   View stack
? expression        -   Evaluate expression

s begin end bytes   -   Search for bytes in range begin to end

Breakpoints
-----------
bp address          -   Set software breakpoint at address
bl                  -   Show list of breakpoints
bc index            -   Clear breakpoint number index
be index            -   Enable breakpoint number index
bd index            -   Disable breakpoint number index

ba [r|w|e][1|2|4] address 
                    - Hardware breakpoint of type [r|w|e] of length [1|2|4] 
                      bytes at address


Examples
@@@@@@@@

r eax               - Show the value of the eax register.

dd esp              - Show the contents of the memory at location esp. Actually
                      shows the contents of the stack.

u eip               - Disassemble the code at location eip, and print it.

? 15 + 3*2          - Calculates the value of 15 + 3*2.

? ecx + edx         - Calculates ecx + edx and prints back the result.

? poi(ebp + 4)      - Shows the contents of the memory at location (ebp + 4).
                      Inside a function this will show the return address of the
                      function call.

s   10000 10200 1 2 - Search for the sequence of bytes 1 2 inside the range of
                      addresses 0x10000 to 0x10200.

bp 10000            - Put a software breakpoint on address 0x10000.

ba r4 10000         - Put a hardware breakpoint of length 4 bytes at address
                      0x10000. Will trigger on read or write to that address.

ba w2 10000         - Put a hardware breakpoint of length 2 bytes at address
                      0x10000. Will trigger on write to that address.

ba e1 10000         - Put a hardware breakpoint of length 1 byte at address
                      0x10000. Will trigger on execution from that address.
                      (Just like a software breakpoint). Note that hardware
                      breakpoints of type e could only be of length 1 byte.

bc 2                - Clear breakpoint number 2.
